<p>Adding image is also similar approach like above. Add class <strong>p-image</strong> to <i>.pretty</i> anf <strong>image</strong> to <i>&lt;img&gt;</i> tag. </p>
{{block(checkbox_image,'General')}}
<p class="note">Good news is, images are automatically resized to fit in to the checkbox. But still, its wise to use small and transparent images for better results. And Obviously, colors are not applicable to images, unless I am the GOD.</p>
